This mobile application was developed as part of my Computer Science degree project at the University of Strathclyde. The app summarises crime data into a single concise system using the Scottish and English open governmental datasets. It enables users to search between areas and their neighbours to view crime statistics.

Made with:

- React Native
- Expo Go
- TypeScript

## Run locally

```bash
npm install && npx expo start
```
